Existing singing voice datasets either do not capture a large range of vocal techniques, have very few singers, or are single-pitch and devoid of musical context. {VocalSet} captures not only a range of vowels, but also a diverse set of voices on many different vocal techniques, sung in contexts of scales, arpeggios, long tones, and excerpts. {VocalSet} has recordings of 10.1 hours of 20 professional singers (11 male, 9 female) performing 17 different different vocal techniques. This data will facilitate the development of new machine learning models for singer identification, vocal technique identification, singing generation and other related applications. To illustrate this, we establish baseline results on vocal technique classification and singer identification by training convolutional network classifiers on {VocalSet} to perform these tasks.},

  abstract   = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) are increasingly used in many areas of computer vision. They are particularly attractive because of their ability to {\textquotedblleft}absorb{\textquotedblright} great quantities of labeled data through millions of parameters. However, as model sizes increase, so do the storage and memory requirements of the classifiers, hindering many applications such as image and speech recognition on mobile phones and other devices. In this paper, we present a novel network architecture, Frequency-Sensitive Hashed Nets ({FreshNets}), which exploits inherent redundancy in both convolutional layers and fully-connected layers of a deep learning model, leading to dramatic savings in memory and storage consumption. Based on the key observation that the weights of learned convolutional filters are typically smooth and low-frequency, we first convert filter weights to the frequency domain with a discrete cosine transform ({DCT}) and use a low-cost hash function to randomly group frequency parameters into hash buckets. All parameters assigned the same hash bucket share a single value learned with standard backpropagation. To further reduce model size, we allocate fewer hash buckets to high-frequency components, which are generally less important. We evaluate {FreshNets} on eight data sets, and show that it leads to better compressed performance than several relevant baselines.},

Data compression can also speed up a transmission of data from one person to another. In performing a compression requires a method of data compression that can be used, the method can then be used to compress a data. Data that can be compressed not only text data but can be images and video. Data compression technique is divided into 2 namely lossy compression and lossless compression. But which is often used to perform a compression that is lossless compression. A kind of lossless compressions such as Huffman, Shannon Fano, Tunstall, Lempel Ziv welch and run-length encoding. Each method has the ability to perform a different compression. This paper explains how a method works in doing a compression and explains which method is well used in doing a data compression in the form of text. The output generated in doing a can be known through the compression file size that becomes smaller than the original file.},

  abstract       = {Checkpoint restart plays an important role in high-performance computing ({HPC}) applications, allowing simulation runtime to extend beyond a single job allocation and facilitating recovery from hardware failure. Yet, as machines grow in size and in complexity, traditional approaches to checkpoint restart are becoming prohibitive. Current methods store a subset of the application{\textquoteright}s state and exploit the memory hierarchy in the machine. However, as the energy cost of data movement continues to dominate, further reductions in checkpoint size are needed. Lossy compression, which can significantly reduce checkpoint sizes, offers a potential to reduce computational cost in checkpoint restart. This article investigates the use of numerical properties of partial differential equation ({PDE}) simulations, such as bounds on the truncation error, to evaluate the feasibility of using lossy compression in checkpointing {PDE} simulations. Restart from a checkpoint with lossy compression is considered for a fail-stop error in two time-dependent {HPC} application codes: {PlasComCM} and Nek5000. Results show that error in application variables due to a restart from a lossy compressed checkpoint can be masked by the numerical error in the discretization, leading to increased efficiency in checkpoint restart without influencing overall accuracy in the simulation.},

Data from sequencing technologies are typically represented as a string of bases, an associated sequence of per-base quality scores and other metadata, and in aggregate can require a large amount of space. The quality scores show how accurate the bases are with respect to the sequencing process, that is, how confident the sequencer is of having called them correctly, and are the largest component in datasets in which they are retained. Previous research has examined how to store sequences of bases effectively; here we add to that knowledge by examining methods for compressing quality scores. The quality values originate in a continuous domain, and so if a fidelity criterion is introduced, it is possible to introduce flexibility in the way these values are represented, allowing lossy compression over the quality score data.},

  abstract     = {Audio data compression has revolutionised the way in which the music industry and musicians sell and distribute their products. Our previous research presented a novel codec named {ACER} (Audio Compression Exploiting Repetition), which achieves data reduction by exploiting irrelevancy and redundancy in musical structure whilst generally maintaining acceptable levels of noise and distortion in objective evaluations. However, previous work did not evaluate {ACER} using subjective listening tests, leaving a gap to demonstrate its applicability under human audio perception tests. In this paper, we present a double-blind listening test that was conducted with a range of listeners (N=100). The aim was to determine the efficacy of the {ACER} codec, in terms of perceptible noise and spatial distortion artefacts, against de facto standards for audio data compression and an uncompressed reference. Results show that participants reported no perceived differences between the uncompressed, {MP}3, {AAC}, {ACER} high quality, and {ACER} medium quality compressed audio in terms of noise and distortions but that the {ACER} low quality format was perceived as being of lower quality. However, in terms of participants{\textquoteright} perceptions of the stereo field, all formats under test performed as well as each other, with no statistically significant differences. A qualitative, thematic analysis of listeners{\textquoteright} feedback revealed that the noise artefacts that produced the {ACER} technique are different from those of comparator codecs, reflecting its novel approach. Results show that the quality of contemporary audio compression systems has reached a stage where their performance is perceived to be as good as uncompressed audio. The {ACER} format is able to compete as an alternative, with results showing a preference for the {ACER} medium quality versions over {WAV}, {MP}3, and {AAC}. The {ACER} process itself is viable on its own or in conjunction with techniques such as {MP}3 and {AAC}.},

  abstract  = {Lossy compression algorithms are typically designed and analyzed through the lens of Shannon{\textquoteright}s rate-distortion theory, where the goal is to achieve the lowest possible distortion (e.g., low {MSE} or high {SSIM}) at any given bit rate. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that {\textquotedblleft}low distortion{\textquotedblright} is not a synonym for {\textquotedblleft}high perceptual quality{\textquotedblright}, and in fact optimization of one often comes at the expense of the other. In light of this understanding, it is natural to seek for a generalization of rate-distortion theory which takes perceptual quality into account. In this paper, we adopt the mathematical definition of perceptual quality recently proposed by Blau \& Michaeli (2018), and use it to study the three-way tradeoff between rate, distortion, and perception. We show that restricting the perceptual quality to be high, generally leads to an elevation of the rate-distortion curve, thus necessitating a sacrifice in either rate or distortion. We prove several fundamental properties of this triple-tradeoff, calculate it in closed form for a Bernoulli source, and illustrate it visually on a toy {MNIST} example.},

Many methods have been proposed to encode and transmit multiple audio objects at a low bit-rate. However, the recovered audio objects have severe frequency aliasing distortion, which will destroy the immersive sound quality. This paper describes a new structure to reduce every object{\textquoteright}s aliasing distortion. In this method, we extract residual and gain parameters of all objects after N-step operation and use singular value decomposition to compress the residual matrices. The residual matrices can compensate for aliasing distortion in the decoding part. Moreover, we find a proper ordering strategy experimentally to determine the object coding order because it will affect the final decoded quality. From experiment results, the energy sorting strategy is chosen as the best ordering strategy, and the residual information bit-rate can be reduced from 14.11 kbps/per object to 5.87 kbps/per object. Compared with previous studies, our method gets better performance in objective and subjective experiments. The proposed N-step residual compensating structure can reduce every object{\textquoteright}s aliasing distortion better than the state-ofthe-art methods.},

However, while the speed of different devices is extremely growing, the speed of data transfer is increasing significantly slower. The peculiarity of the majority types of data is their redundancy. Due to this, nowadays the compression algorithms are widely used to provide efficient storage and transfer of information. The objective of the work is the study and analysis of modern formats of lossy audio information compression. At present, a significant number of formats of audio compression are used. They all have pros and cons. This study is performed to find out which format is the most effective and successfully replaced {MP}3 -- one of the most popular formats.},

In this article, we evaluate a number of selected lossy compression methods from the literature and extensively analyze their performance in terms of compression efficiency, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Specifically, we first carry out a performance evaluation of existing and new compression schemes, considering linear, autoregressive, {FFT}-/{DCT}- and wavelet-based models , by looking at their performance as a function of relevant signal statistics. Second, we obtain formulas through numerical fittings to gauge their overall energy consumption and signal representation accuracy. Third, we evaluate the benefits that lossy compression methods bring about in interference-limited multihop networks, where the channel access is a source of inefficiency due to collisions and transmission scheduling. Our results reveal that the {DCT}-based schemes are the best option in terms of compression efficiency but are inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Instead, linear methods lead to substantial savings in terms of energy expenditure by, at the same time, leading to satisfactory compression ratios, reduced network delay, and increased reliability performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a technique to incorporate psychoacoustic models into an adaptive wavelet packet scheme to achieve perceptually transparent compression of high-quality (44.1 {kHz}) audio signals at about 45 kb/s. The filter bank structure adapts according to psychoacoustic criteria and according to the computational complexity that is available at the decoder. This permits software implementations that can perform according to the computational power available in order to achieve real time coding/decoding. The bit allocation scheme is an adapted zero-tree algorithm that also takes input from the psychoacoustic model. The measure of performance is a quantity called subband perceptual rate, which the filter bank structure adapts to approach the perceptual entropy ({PE}) as closely as possible. In addition, this method is also amenable to progressive transmission, that is, it can achieve the best quality of reconstruction possible considering the size of the bit stream available at the encoder. The result is a variablerate compression scheme for high-quality audio that takes into account the allowed computational complexity, the available bitbudget, and the psychoacoustic criteria for transparent coding. This paper thus provides a novel scheme to marry the results in wavelet packets and perceptual coding to construct an algorithm that is well suited to high-quality audio transfer for internet and storage applications.},

In other words, bandwidth cost money, therefore, the transmission and storage of information becomes costly. However, if we can use less data, both transmission and storage become cheaper. Further reduction in bit rate is an attractive proposition in applications like remote broadcast lines, studio links, satellite transmission of high quality audio and voice over internet.},

These are transform codecs originally designed for achieving {CDlike} quality on one hand, and specialized speech codecs on the other hand. Both of these techniques usually represent the audio signal waveform in a way such that the decoder output signal gives an approximation of the encoder input signal, while taking into account perceptual criteria. Compared to this approach, in parametric audio coding the models of the signal source and of human perception are extended. The source model is now based on the assumption that the audio signal is the sum of {\textquotedblleft}components,{\textquotedblright} each of which can be approximated by a relatively simple signal model with a small number of parameters. The perception model is based on the assumption that the sound of the decoder output signal should be as similar as possible to that of the encoder input signal. Therefore, the approximation of waveforms is no longer necessary. This approach can lead to a very efficient representation. However, a suitable set of models for signal components, a good decomposition, and a good parameter estimation are all vital for achieving maximum audio quality.},

The analysis shows moderate amounts of data reduction take place whilst the system is operating within parameters designed to maintain high-levels of perceptual audio quality, whilst lower rates of perceptual quality yield greater data reduction.

Moore (2008) suggested that reduced sensitivity to temporal fine structure ({TFS}) may be associated with preference for slow compression. This idea was tested using a simulated hearing aid. It was also assessed whether preferences for compression speed depend on the type of stimulus: speech or music. Twenty-two hearing-impaired subjects were tested, and the stimulated hearing aid was fitted individually using the {CAM}2A method. On each trial, a given segment of speech or music was presented twice. One segment was processed with fast compression and the other with slow compression, and the order was balanced across trials. The subject indicated which segment was preferred and by how much. On average, slow compression was preferred over fast compression, more so for music, but there were distinct individual differences, which were highly correlated for speech and music. Sensitivity to {TFS} was assessed using the difference limen for frequency at 2000 Hz and by two measures of sensitivity to interaural phase at low frequencies. The results for the difference limens for frequency, but not the measures of sensitivity to interaural phase, supported the suggestion that preference for compression speed is affected by sensitivity to {TFS}.},

As a first step towards a general understanding of this trade-off, we use a tool from information theory, rate--distortion theory, to study large, unstructured environments with fixed, randomly drawn penalties for stimuli confusion ({\textquoteleft}distortions{\textquoteright}). We identify two distinct regimes for organisms in these environments: a high-fidelity regime where perceptual costs grow linearly with environmental complexity, and a low-fidelity regime where perceptual costs are, remarkably, independent of the number of environmental states. This suggests that in environments of rapidly increasing complexity, well-adapted organisms will find themselves able to make, just barely, the most subtle distinctions in their environment.},

Experiments were conducted on the same three audio files but with different channel configurations. The performance of each encoder was evaluated based on its encoding time (averaged over 100 times), data reduction, and audio quality. Usually, there is always a trade-off between the three metrics. To simplify the evaluation, a new integrated performance metric was proposed that combines all the three performance metrics. Using the new measure, {FLAC} was found to be the best lossless compression, while Ogg Vorbis and Opus were found to be the best for lossy compression depends on the channel configuration. This result could be used in determining the proper audio format for multichannel audio systems.},

We evaluated this system with audio excerpts from songs and movies, compressed into various coding formats, using different bit rates, and captured digitally as well as through analog transfer.

Due to these factors, it has become the norm for modern graphics-heavy websites to transmit low-resolution, low-bytecount image previews (thumbnails) as part of the initial page load process to improve apparent page responsiveness. Increasing thumbnail compression beyond the capabilities of existing codecs is therefore a current research focus, as any byte savings will significantly enhance the experience of mobile device users. Toward this end, we propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional {LSTM} recurrent networks. Our models address the main issues that have prevented autoencoder neural networks from competing with existing image compression algorithms: (1) our networks only need to be trained once (not per-image), regardless of input image dimensions and the desired compression rate; (2) our networks are progressive, meaning that the more bits are sent, the more accurate the image reconstruction; and (3) the proposed architecture is at least as efficient as a standard purpose-trained autoencoder for a given number of bits. On a large-scale benchmark of 32$\times$32 thumbnails, our {LSTM}-based approaches provide better visual quality than (headerless) {JPEG}, {JPEG}2000 and {WebP}, with a storage size that is reduced by 10\% or more.},

The transforms are constructed in three successive stages of convolutional linear filters and nonlinear activation functions. Unlike most convolutional neural networks, the joint nonlinearity is chosen to implement a form of local gain control, inspired by those used to model biological neurons. Using a variant of stochastic gradient descent, we jointly optimize the entire model for rate--distortion performance over a database of training images, introducing a continuous proxy for the discontinuous loss function arising from the quantizer. Under certain conditions, the relaxed loss function may be interpreted as the log likelihood of a generative model, as implemented by a variational autoencoder. Unlike these models, however, the compression model must operate at any given point along the rate--distortion curve, as specified by a trade-off parameter. Across an independent set of test images, we find that the optimized method generally exhibits better rate--distortion performance than the standard {JPEG} and {JPEG} 2000 compression methods. More importantly, we observe a dramatic improvement in visual quality for all images at all bit rates, which is supported by objective quality estimates using {MS}-{SSIM}.},

New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with {JPEG} 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on {RNNs}. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.},

Fuzzy neural network effectively integrates neural network technology and fuzzy technology; combines learning, selfadaptivity, imagination and identity and uses rule-based reasoning and fuzzy information processing in the nodes; thus greatly improving the transparency of fuzzy neural network. This paper mainly investigates the applications of fuzzy neural network in image compression and realizes the image compression and reconstruction of fuzzy neural network. It is demonstrated in the simulation experiment that the image compression algorithm based on fuzzy neural network has significant advantages in training speed, compression quality and robustness.},

Each of the architectures we describe can provide variable compression rates during deployment without requiring retraining of the network: each network need only be trained once. All of our architectures consist of a recurrent neural network ({RNN})-based encoder and decoder, a binarizer, and a neural network for entropy coding. We compare {RNN} types ({LSTM}, associative {LSTM}) and introduce a new hybrid of {GRU} and {ResNet}. We also study {\textquotedblleft}one-shot{\textquotedblright} versus additive reconstruction architectures and introduce a new scaled-additive framework. We compare to previous work, showing improvements of 4.3\%--8.8\% {AUC} (area under the rate-distortion curve), depending on the perceptual metric used. As far as we know, this is the first neural network architecture that is able to outperform {JPEG} at image compression across most bitrates on the rate-distortion curve on the Kodak dataset images, with and without the aid of entropy coding.},

We introduce three improvements over previous research that lead to this state-of-the-art result. First, we show that training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by {SSIM} increases reconstruction quality according to several metrics. Second, we modify the recurrent architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more effectively capture and propagate image information through the network{\textquoteright}s hidden state. Finally, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efficiently use the limited number of bits to encode visually complex image regions. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and Tecnick image sets and compare against standard codecs as well recently published methods based on deep neural networks.},

Compressing data should be an important aspect of the huge volume to improve the overall performance of the Big data management system and Big data analytics. There is a quiet few compression methods that can reduce the cost of data management and data transfer and improve efficiency of data analysis. Adaptive data compression approach finds out the suitable data compression technique and the location of the data compression. De-duplication removes duplicate data from the Big data store. Resemblance detection and elimination algorithm uses two techniques namely, Dup-Adj and improved super-feature approach. Using them the similar data chunks are separated from non-similar data chunks. The Delta compression is also used to compress the data before storage. The general compression algorithms are computationally complex and also degrade the application response time. To address this application-specific {ZIP}-{IO} framework for {FPGA} accelerated compression is studied. In this framework a simple instruction trace entropy compression algorithm is implemented in {FPGA} substrate. The Record-aware Compression ({RaC}) technique guarantees that the splitting of compressed data blocks does not contain partial records in the data blocks and it is implemented in Hadoop {MapReduce}.},

However, these recent results have not been fully exploited due to some confusion about how these new rate distortion bounds, once they are obtained, should be interpreted and should be used in source codec performance analysis and design. We present the relevant rate distortion theory and show how this theory can be used for practical codec design and performance prediction and evaluation. Examples for speech and video indicate exactly how the new rate distortion functions can be calculated, interpreted, and extended. These examples illustrate the interplay between source models for rate distortion theoretic studies and the source models underlying video and speech codec design. Key concepts include the development of composite source models per source realization and the application of conditional rate distortion theory.},

In this article, we will investigate how to identify a decompressed wave audio that went through one of three popular compression schemes, including {MP}3, {WMA} (windows media audio) and {AAC} (advanced audio coding). By analyzing the corresponding frequency coefficients, including modified discrete cosine transform ({MDCT}) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients ({MFCCs}), of those original audio clips and their decompressed versions with different compression schemes and bit rates, we propose several statistics to identify the compression scheme as well as the corresponding bit rate previously used for a given {WAV} signal. The experimental results evaluated on 8,800 audio clips with various contents have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, some potential applications of the proposed method are discussed.},

This paper investigates the effects of latency (020ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present findings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms $\pm$ 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was significantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no significant difference in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no significant difference in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without significantly affecting the timing performance of our participants. These findings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.},

The combined v3 release of {ViSQOL} and {ViSQOLAudio} (for speech and audio, respectively,) provides improvements upon previous versions, in terms of both design and usage. As an open source C++ library or binary with permissive licensing, {ViSQOL} can now be deployed beyond the research context into production usage. The feedback from internal production teams at Google has helped to improve this new release, and serves to show cases where it is most applicable, as well as to highlight limitations. The new model is benchmarked against real-world data for evaluation purposes. The trends and direction of future work is discussed.},

Many large service providers continually alter codecs to improve the encoding process. Performing subjective tests to validate each codec alteration would be impractical, necessitating the use of objective perceptual audio quality models. This paper evaluates the quality scores from {ViSQOLAudio}, an objective perceptual audio quality model, against the quality scores of {PEAQ}, {POLQA}, and {PEMO}-Q on three datasets containing fullband audio encoded with a variety of codecs and bitrates. The results show that {ViSQOLAudio} was more accurate than all other models on two of the datasets and performed well on the third, demonstrating the utility of {ViSQOLAudio} for predicting the perceptual audio quality for encoded music.},

However, the undershoots occur frequently in the cubic spline envelopes. To improve them, in our previous paper we proposed a new envelope algorithm, which is an iterative process by using the Monotone Piecewise Cubic Interpolation. Experiments show very satisfying results. But the theoretical analysis on why and how it works well was not given there. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. We will study the structure of undershoots, prove rigorously that the algorithm converges to an envelope without undershoots with exponential rate of convergence, which can be used to determine the number of iterations needed in the algorithm for a good envelope in applications.},
